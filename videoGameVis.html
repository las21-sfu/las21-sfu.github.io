        <h3>Insight 1: Variance in Regional Consumer Behavior and Genres</h3>
        <div class="summary-text" id="insight-1">
          <p>
            Analysis of the dataset reveals a geographical disparity in genre
            sales, specifically between North American and Japanese markets.
            While North America consistently serves as the primary driver for
            global sales, the Japanese market exhibits consumption patterns that
            diverge from Western trends. This is evident in the performance of
            specific genres such as Western-developed Shooters and Action
            titles, which frequently rely on the North American market. For
            instance, Duck Hunt recorded 26.93 million units in North America
            but only 0.28 million in Japan. Title-level data for Pokemon
            Red/Blue demonstrates an instance of market symmetry, achieving
            near-parity with 11.27 million units in North America and 10.22
            million in Japan.

        <h3>Insight 2: Market Concentration and Publisher Specialization</h3>
        <div class="summary-text" id="insight-2">
          <p>
            The distribution of sales by publisher illustrates how corporate
            entities leverage regional advantages to secure market share.
            Microsoft Game Studios utilizes a strategy which targets the North
            American consumer, as seen with Halo 3, which sold 7.97 million
            units in North America compared to 0.13 million in Japan. In
            contrast, Electronic Arts (EA) is significant in the European market
            through its sports franchises; for example, FIFA 16 on the PS4 sold
            6.06 million units in Europe, and in North America, it sold 1.11
            million units. Nintendo remains an outlier as the only publisher in
            the dataset that maintains a balanced global revenue stream across
            all three primary territories. Furthermore, the data also suggests
            that hardware success is intrinsically linked to these regional
            publisher strengths; the Xbox 360’s global standing was driven
            almost entirely by North American demand, while the PC segment in
            this dataset is predominantly European based, exemplified by the
            performance of titles like The Sims 3 (6.42M EU vs 0.98M NA) and
            World of Warcraft (6.21M EU vs 0.07M NA).

        <h3>
          Insight 3: Industry Maturation and the Shift Toward Market
          Consolidation
        </h3>
        <div class="summary-text" id="insight-3">
          <p>
            A longitudinal analysis of release data indicates a transition from
            an early market to a consolidated economy. The 2000s were
            characterized by an increase in unit volume and hardware, largely
            driven by the Wii and DS platforms. This period produced statistical
            outliers, such as Wii Sports, which sold 82.74 million units.
            However, as the industry progressed into the 2010s, the data shows a
            distinct shift toward market consolidation. Global sales volume
            became increasingly concentrated within a limited number of
            high-budget franchises, such as Grand Theft Auto V (21.40 million on
            PS3) and the Call of Duty series, which are frequently re-released
            across multiple hardware generations to mitigate financial risk.
            This maturation is empirically supported by the gap between the mean
            global sales (~0.54M) and the median (0.17M). This skewed
            distribution confirms that the industry currently relies on
            high-performing titles to subsidize lower-selling, niche products.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        The visualization highlights patterns across platforms and genres.
        Certain platforms generate higher global sales, particularly when paired
        with genres like Action and Sports. The darker and larger circles
        indicate market concentration, showing that a number of platform-genre
        combinations account for a substantial share of total sales. Strategy
        titles popularity vary depending on platform popularity, reinforcing how
        platforms influence genre performance. I selected a bubble matrix to
        reveal how consoles like the Wii are defined by specific genres like
        Sports. This design effectively highlights outliers through the dual
        encoding of size and color for global sales, providing a density map
        that is more scannable than traditional charts.

          genre (such as Shooters for the X360) or different categories? How
          does the genre distribution of the DS and SNES compare to competitors
          like the PS2 and X360?

        The donut charts quantify the proportional distribution of global
        software sales by genre across four hardware platforms. This
        visualization indicates that the Xbox 360 library is characterized by
        market concentration in the Shooter and Action genres, whereas the SNES
        is predominantly based in the Platform category. The Nintendo DS is less
        concentrated within genres, with revenue distributed across
        Role-Playing, Platform, and miscellaneous titles. This layout
        distinguishes platforms that depend on genre specialization from those
        with multi-categorical genre specialization. I selected donut charts to
        analyze the proportional variance of genre reliance across platforms,
        allowing for a comparative audit of market concentration independent of
        absolute sales volume. Design choices, such as the standardized inner
        radius and bottom-aligned legend, optimize horizontal space to ensure
        comparisons remain legible within the dashboard.

        An area chart was chosen to visualize the growth of the global market
        from 1980 to 2017, disaggregated by platform, while observing the
        market-entry timelines of individual hardware platforms. The video game
        industry has evolved from a period of diversity, peaking during the
        mid-2000s Wii and DS era, into a consolidated market where sales volume
        is concentrated within a limited number of platforms like PlayStation 4
        and Xbox One. This longitudinal transition corresponds with a shift in
        consumer purchases of Action and Sports franchises, while previously
        prominent categories like Puzzles experienced a decline in unit volume.
        Additonally, the market has transitioned into a hit-driven economy where
        major publishers leverage Microsoft’s dominance in North America and
        Electronic Arts’ European stronghold to launch releases that subsidize
        niche games. In terms of design, the stacked encoding effectively
        communicates industry volume peaks, such as the 2007–2010 surge, while
        the color-coding reveals the dominance of manufacturers across hardware
        generations.

        This chart compares regional sales totals for the PC, PS4, WiiU, and
        XOne across European, North American, Japanese, and “other sales”
        territories. I chose this visualization as I was curious to see if
        specific platforms achieved uniform success or relied on territorial
        market share. Results demonstrate the PS4’s popularity across different
        regions, and the PC’s reliance on the European market relative to its
        North American performance. I implemented a stacked bar chart to analyze
        the absolute and relative success of contemporary hardware platforms in
        relation to specific regions. To enhance clarity, I utilized categorical
        colors to represent each manufacturer, allowing for an immediate visual
        understanding of which platform corresponded with which colour. Grouping
        by market territory facilitates an immediate understanding of platform
        performance within local context, and horizontal stacking communicates
        total market scale.

        This visualization maps sales totals of specific platforms to identify
        performance correlations. Data reflects regional patterns, as North
        American consumers buy Xbox and PlayStation consoles, whereas Japanese
        markets exhibit a preference for Nintendo platforms and portable
        hardware. Consequently, Microsoft platforms show a regional dependency
        on North America, while Sony and Nintendo achieve an international
        scope. I utilized layered line graphs to investigate these correlations,
        facilitating an audit of which hardware transcended regional cultural
        barriers. This design highlights the parallel trajectories between
        secondary markets, displaying that platforms popular in Europe are
        typically popular in other regions.

        This heatmap measures revenue as a percentage to evaluate geographic
        dependency independent of absolute sales volume. High colour intensity
        in the NA column for the X360 and XOne confirms a high reliance on North
        American demand. I implemented a heatmap to analyze market
        concentration, as I was curious to identify which platforms required
        regional dominance for viability versus those with diversified global
        revenue. This design effectively isolates specialization from total
        volume, while the gradient intensity scale facilitates the

        This scatter plot was created due to my curiosity about how North
        American and Japanese sales volumes of sales at the platform level can
        be used to measure geographic parity. Nintendo handhelds cluster near
        the diagonal line of parity, while the Xbox ecosystem is isolated along
        the horizontal axis, indicating a failure to achieve Japanese market
        sales. I utilized a scatter plot to measure the degree of geographic
        symmetry in platform success, focusing on the divide between Western and
        Japanese markets. This layout uses the diagonal parity line as a
        technical benchmark to distinguish platforms with balanced global appeal
        from those confined to a single hemisphere. To facilitate the immediate
        identification of consoles within dense data clusters, I implemented
        categorical colours paired with geometric marks, such as triangles for
        the DS and squares for the PS2, ensuring each hardware remains legible

        This plot disaggregates the dataset to the title level to map NA vs. JP
        performance, with mark size representing Global Sales as I was curious
        as to how different titles performed in different markets. The high
        statistical density of records concentrated within the 0 to 2 million
        unit range empirically demonstrates the right-skewed distribution of the
        industry, where the vast majority of games generate marginal revenue
        compared to high-volume outliers, like Pokémon Red/Blue, which exhibit
        high symmetry, whereas titles like Duck Hunt show a skew toward the
        North American axis. This title-level scatter plot was chosen to
        visualize the geographic distribution of individual software hits, using
        the x/y axes to expose performance discrepancies. Encoding global sales
        to mark area and colour adds a third dimension that allows for the
        simultaneous analysis of volume and geographic concentration.

        I chose this title-level heatmap because I was curious to see if the
        industry's highest-selling games achieved their status through global or
        regional appeal. This matrix provides a title-by-title comparison of NA,
        JP, and Global sales for the industry's highest-performing games. The
        contrast between the NA and JP columns confirms that global rankings are
        frequently achieved through North American market dominance rather than
        international sales. I selected a title-based heatmap to allow for a
        side-by-side comparison of regional unit contributions to total global
        rank. The high-contrast colour scheme differentiates titles with
        international intensity from those that remain "dark" in specific market
        columns.
