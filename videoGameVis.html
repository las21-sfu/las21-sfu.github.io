        The visualization highlights clear dominance patterns across platforms and genres.
        Certain platforms generate significantly higher global sales, particularly when paired
        with popular genres like Action and Sports. The darker and larger circles indicate strong
        market concentration, showing that a limited number of platform–genre combinations account
        for a substantial share of total sales. Strategy titles vary depending on platform strength,
        reinforcing how platform popularity strongly influences genre performance.

          Does a specific platform's global success depend on a single dominant genre

        The donut charts reveal that each console has a distinct "genre personality." The X360 is
        dominated by Shooters and Action titles reflecting its Western-skewing install base, while
        the SNES shows a more balanced distribution rooted in Platform and RPG heritage. The DS
        stands out with a uniquely diverse library driven by Nintendo's broad software strategy.
        Comparing these four consoles side-by-side makes it easy to see which platforms were defined
        by a single genre and which cultivated diverse audiences.

        The area chart reveals a clear expansion and contraction arc across game genres over time.
        The mid-2000s Wii and DS boom is visible as a spike in Action and Sports titles, while
        the 2010s show consolidation—fewer platforms, higher per-title sales. Clicking a platform
        colour highlights its trajectory and makes year-over-year comparison intuitive, while the

        Japan compared to the XOne illustrates Nintendo's enduring home-market appeal. The PC
        shows a notably even spread across regions, reinforcing its platform-agnostic, globally
        distributed user base. Grouping by region rather than platform makes cross-regional
        comparisons effortless.

        The visualization reveals distinct regional preferences across gaming platforms.
        North American sales dominate for most platforms, particularly for Xbox and PlayStation
        consoles, reflecting strong brand loyalty and market penetration in the region. Japanese
        sales show pronounced preference for Nintendo platforms and handheld devices, demonstrating
        the cultural affinity for portable gaming and local brands. European sales patterns closely
        mirror North American trends but at lower absolute volumes, suggesting similar gaming
        preferences across Western markets. Other regions contribute modestly across all platforms,
        indicating developing markets or limited data coverage.

          This plot identifies "Cultural Bridge" platforms. Platforms closer to the diagonal

        The symmetry scatter reveals a stark divide: Nintendo platforms cluster near the diagonal,
        confirming balanced NA and JP appeal, while Microsoft's Xbox ecosystem sits far off-axis
        with massive NA totals and negligible JP sales. The PS2 and PS3 occupy a middle ground —
        strong in NA but with meaningful JP presence — showing that Sony's cross-Pacific strategy
        was the most effective of the three publishers. Platforms that fall along the diagonal
        are true "cultural bridges."

        I chose a scatterplot because it is the most effective way to simultaneously reveal three
        variables — NA Sales, JP Sales, and Global Sales — for hundreds of individual game titles
        at once. The x/y axes directly expose the relationship between two regional markets, making
        it immediately clear whether a title resonated in one region but not the other (dots
        hugging the axes) versus titles with balanced cross-regional appeal (dots spread
        diagonally). Encoding Global Sales as circle size adds a third dimension without cluttering
        the view, letting the eye naturally group blockbusters from niche titles. Each game name is
        colour-coded so that individual titles remain distinguishable on hover, while the
        click-to-highlight interaction allows viewers to isolate any single dot and read its exact
        values through the tooltip without losing the overall distribution for context.

          By comparing specific titles across the North American (NA), Japanese (JP), and Global

        The heatmap makes the "regional divergence story" legible at a glance for the industry's
        very top titles. Games like Wii Sports and Duck Hunt light up the NA column dramatically
        while remaining dark in JP, confirming their status as Western cultural phenomena rather
        than universal hits. Pokemon Red/Blue is the standout exception — it is the only entry
        in the top tier to show strong colour intensity across all three columns, making it a
        genuine global blockbuster that transcended the East-West divide.
